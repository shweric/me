Since I just moved to Boston, I'm generally interested in everything in this area. I'm definitely interested in its covid data  and possibly finding patterns of such data in the area, however i can yet to trace the source. As an alternative, the data I'v found is about wifi locations, where the are 3 rows and 7469 column of data, which includes data of Neighboorhood and connection found.
