# CODE1161

This repo is for the code that runs this course. It has mainly the tests that check if your code is working as it should.

We often update the tests to make them more helpful. If we update these tests, then we'll let you know. To make sure that your copy is in line with the master copy, you need to _pull_ either from the UI in the _Source Control_ tab or by typing `git pull` in the terminal.

It's not cheating to read the test code, it might help you understand something. If you think that an exercise is confusingly written, or if the answer isn't clear, then [submit an issue](https://github.com/Design-Computing/CODE1161-2019/issues). We really want to make this course better so if you do submit an issue, we'll be incredibly grateful!

You can't write to this repo, but you can submit a pull request if you think you've found a way to make something better.
