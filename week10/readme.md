TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
Imported more of the data in and getting familiarize. Composed most of the graphes. Realized that learning matplotlib is like another language. Also realised that Week 5 is supposedly handed in and I havent. Done it and hopefully it counts.
